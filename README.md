- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Marine - welcome to my githubpage. 

- ðŸ‘€ I'm a scientist interested in climate change, carbon cycle and forest ecology.

- ðŸŒ± I started as a atmospheric modeller interested in the carbon cycle, and in recent years have become more interested in photosynthesis processes and forest ecology. For the last two years, I studied Carbonyl Sulfide as a photosynthesis tracer in order to constrain the amount of carbon absorbed by plants at global scale. I currently work on the modellisation of forest disturbances in the ORCHIDEE Land Surface Model.

- ðŸ“«  If you have questions, requests, or ideas you can contact me using the email marine.remaud@gmail.com
