- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Marine Remaud @mremaud
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in forest ecology and land surface modelling.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently doing a post-doc at LSCE (France). I study Carbonyl Sulfide as a photosynthesis tracer in order to constrain the amount of carbon absorbed by plants at global scale. I am also working on the representation of forest disturbances in the ORCHIDEE Land Surface Model.
